# CS-370
Project Overview

For this course, I submitted my Jupyter Notebook file for the pirate intelligent agent into my GitHub repository. This project demonstrates my ability to apply key concepts in reinforcement learning and neural networks to a real-world problem.

Work Completed

I worked with provided base code and implemented my own solutions to enhance the pirate intelligent agent. The given code provided the framework, while I created logic for reinforcement learning and tuned the neural network to improve the agent's performance.

Connection to Computer Science

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter?

Computer scientists develop algorithms, create software, and solve complex problems using computational thinking. This work is essential in advancing technology, improving efficiency, and enhancing user experiences across various industries.

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

I approach problems by breaking them down into smaller, manageable components. In this project, I analyzed the requirements, researched reinforcement learning techniques, iteratively tested solutions, and refined the model to improve performance.

Ethical Responsibilities to the End User and Organization

As a computer scientist, I am responsible for ensuring that the solutions I create are ethical, fair, and unbiased. It is important to design AI models that do not reinforce harmful biases, protect user data, and operate transparently to maintain trust and reliability.
